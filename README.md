# The_mirror_unity_game
2D Rpg game demo wirtten in C#

This is a collaborated project of Dyck, Pan and Wang.
Thanks to Dyck and Pan from James Wang.
The game is pretty much self explanatory. The hero has an ability to transform between the upside of word and darkside of the world. The structure of the two side of the world will be different and some how the player can use this to achieve their goal.
There were no sepecific goals for players in the demo. The major thing player will do is to kill the minions that get in their way.

2021.1.24 Update: The game files are too big for github, Currently seeking for other ways to share online.
